there are 3 types of registers:
	- the integer ones
	- the double ones
	- the special ones

integer registers:
	there is 7 integer register that can hold each a u32
	these registers are named:
		- do
		- do$
		- re
		- re$
		- mi
		- fa
		- fa$
		- so
		- so$
		- la
		- la$
		- si
		- in
		- ou
		- sp
		- bp

double registers:
	there is 8 double register that can hold each a double
	they are named:
		- red
		- green
		- blue
		- magenta
		- yellow
		- cyan
		- white
		- black


special registers:
	these register are not for general purpose they are mainly use be the cpu and are
	not always directly accessible they are all u32 registers
	there is 4 special register
		- pc     : programme counter (points to the current instruction)
		- sp     : stack pointer (points to the last element put on the stack)
		- bp     : base pointer (points to the start of the stack)
		- status : store status information about the cpu

	pc can only be read and moved to si
	sp can be modified by any of the integers register
	bp can be modified by any of the integers register
	status can only be read or moved from and to la$
