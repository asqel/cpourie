integers are presented as one of the following four types:
	- u8  | 8  bits / 1 Byte
	- u16 | 16 bits / 2 Bytes
	- u32 | 32 bits / 4 Bytes

they are store as little endian meaning the least significant Byte is the first in memory
example:
	0x00ABCDEF -> 0xEF, 0xCD, 0xAB, 0x00

signed integers are written as follow:
	-i8
	-i16
	-i32
